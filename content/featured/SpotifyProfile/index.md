- Introduced a novel triply annotated Indian political Memes (IPM) dataset, which comprises memes from various Indian political events that have taken place post-independence.
- Proposed and implemented a binary-channeled CNN and LSTM based model wherein the images are individually processed using the CNN model and the text extracted from the images using the LSTM model. This model gives state-of-the-art results in the domain of offensive image (Memes) classification in code-switched languages.
