- Developed an open source codebase that grades quality and logic of C/C++ codes using feature extraction on a combination of control flow graph and data flow graph. Published a reserach paper documenting our approach.
- Evaluated the performance of different ML models (including SVM, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Ordinal Regression) on our novel dataset consisting of multiple coding responses to obtain optimal results.
