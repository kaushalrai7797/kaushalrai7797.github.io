Developed an end to end software called ‘ChatterBox’ to automatically extract the semantics of speech and convert
it into a code in the desired programming language (implemented for C++ and Python). The project was ranked in top
10 among 126 proposed ideas for Effithon (Samsung’s internal hackathon)
