Developed supervised machine learning models (SVM, Linear Regression, Neural Network) to predict SQL query response time. Worked on operator-level query predictors for some of the most common database operations, which include sequential scan, quick sort, hash join, index scan, hashing, limit, and nested loop index scan.
