- Worked as a SWE intern for Stream Processing Team (Puma, Stylus).
- Developed a framework to track the usage pattern of Stylus operators. This helps in identifying
  the applications using deprecated operators and prioritizing commonly used operators.
- Developed an internal website which helped in visualizing the DAG for pipelines using Stylus operators.
- Developed a transform operator that handled filtering, mapping and flatmap functionality. The operator also gave the ability to fuse
  different operators together thereby drastically reduced the run-time for various pipelines.
- Tech Stack - C++, Hack, JavaScript, Python, Thrift, Folly
