- As a part of the GSAM Surveillance team, I worked towards developing codebases to automatically flag trades involved in illegal practices such as pre-arranged trading, trade reallocation, capping and pegging, cancel correct.
- Enhanced the precision of surveillance codebases (approximately 30%) by improving the underlying mathematical model being used. This significantly reduced the manual work required at Compliance Officer's end.
- Improved the coverage of surveillances by including foreign exchange products in scope for Fixed Income trades.
- Developed a codebase to add surveillance logic to a new order management system (OMS). Ensured code compatibility across surveillances and data sourcing tasks to handle new OMS.
- Tech Stack - Hadoop, Map-Reduce Framework, Java, Slang
